## Hi there üëã

## üí´ About Me
I am a Computer Science graduate with a strong foundation in Java, C++ and JavaScript. Driven by a deep curiosity about how technology works, I actively explore various domains of programming and software development.

Currently, I‚Äôm enhancing my understanding of data structures and algorithms while diving into the MERN stack to build dynamic web applications. Additionally, I am expanding my knowledge of cloud computing, particularly with AWS, to better tackle modern software challenges. I stay updated on the latest tools and frameworks and continuously seek ways to grow in this fast-paced field.

Outside of tech, I enjoy exploring new places and cultures, as traveling inspires my creativity. I also have a passion for Hindi literature, especially poetry, which keeps me connected to language and tradition. These interests bring balance and inspiration to my life.
