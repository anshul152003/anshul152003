## 👋 Hi there

## 💫 About Me  
I am a Computer Science graduate with a solid foundation in Java, C++, and JavaScript. Driven by curiosity and a passion for problem-solving, I enjoy exploring various domains of software development.  

I’m currently deepening my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms while building dynamic web applications using the MERN stack. I’m also exploring cloud computing with AWS to better address modern, scalable software challenges.  

Outside of tech, I love exploring new places and cultures, and I have a deep interest in Hindi literature, especially poetry, which keeps me creatively inspired and connected to tradition.

## 🌱 I'm Currently Learning  
- Advanced React patterns  
- Microservices architecture  
- Data Structures and Algorithms  
- AWS Cloud Fundamentals
